**2(a).Distance Between Two Points**
->This program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points(𝑥1,𝑦1)and (𝑥2,𝑦2) in a 2D coordinate system.
The formula for Euclidean distance is:
  **Distance**=(((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2)^0.5)
  
**2(b).Sum of two numbers**
->This program takes two integers as input and calculates their sum
ex-
a=5
b=5
sum=a+b
sum=10
